# MATLAB-based-Turret-Control
A series of MATLAB scripts which aim to orient a turret ahead of a target with methods including considerations of yaw / pitch rates and accelerations in x,y,z directions with relation to the target distance.

To run the scripts, ensure that all scripts are in the same folder. Run files "test.m", "test2.m", or "test3.m" to find results. 

To see the animated figure, uncomment "run('animation.m')".

Optionally, "target_path.m" can be swapped for "target_path_2.m". 

These scripts will receive updates with improvements to the control logic.
